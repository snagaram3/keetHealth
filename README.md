# keetHealth

This project is a assignment from keet Health on Terraform.

ASK 
    - use the AWS provider
    - provision an EC2 instance
    - install Docker
    - run the nginx Docker image
    - output the internal IP
    
**/keetModule is the parent terraform file, that calls the child module under /Module.

This effort is to provision an ec2 instance on AWS and install Docker and run nginx image. 

This job would be helpful to iterate, if you were to scale up ec2 or run your choise of container image.
